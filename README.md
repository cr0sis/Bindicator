# Bindicator Sketch
For ESP8266 Wifi boards

Currently has code involved to drive a WS2811 LED light strip update and notification system, comment out as needed.

If your local city has a json API for your bin collection use this sketch to be informed the day before your collection which receptacle is due to go out. Obviously you can modify the colours/amount of types as you wish with some json knowledge and tweaking the light strip code as you need..
